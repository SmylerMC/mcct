# MC Client Tweaks
I sometime feel like the vanilla Minecraft client is missing some things, this is my attempt at fixing it.
MC Client Tweaks is a Minecraft [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod. It is entirely client side, and the tweaks should work on any server.

## Tweaks:
 * The switch hand key can be used in the survival inventory just like the hotbar keys.
 * The audio output device can be changed in the sound/music options menu without restarting the game.
