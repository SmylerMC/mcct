# MC Client Tweaks
I sometime feel like the vanilla Minecraft client is missing some things, this is my attempt at fixing it.
MC Client Tweaks is a Minecraft [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod. It is entirely client side, and the tweaks should work on any server. Only Minecraft 1.15 is supported at the moment. [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) is required.
Each tweak can be toggled on or off and configured in the configuration screen. It can be accessed by pressing the assigned key binding in-game (J by default), or from the mod information page using [Modmenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu).

## Tweaks:
 #### Inventory:
 * The switch hand key can be used in the survival inventory just like the hotbar keys.
 * You can scroll the mouse to turn pages in the recipe book.
 #### Miscelaneous:
 * The audio output device can be changed in the sound/music options menu without restarting the game.
 * The lava fog density can be ajdusted for better visibility under lava
 
## Compatibility with other mods:
MC Client Tweaks should be compatible with most mods. You can report incompatibility in the issues section. The lava fog tweak may not wotk with some Optifine/Optifabric versions, but has been tested to work with Optifine 15.2_HD_U_G1_pre13 and Optifabric 1.0.0-beta8.
